console.log('Welcome to Poke-A-Square...');

/*
SPECS

When the user clicks begin the timer should start counting down, and the squares should populate with a random color, either red, green, or blue.

When the user clicks on a color the color should become invisible. If the square is blue add one to the score. If the square is red or green the subtract one from the score.

If the user clicks all the blue squares, take them to the next round, repopulate the board with more squares, and restart the timer.

If the timer gets to 0 update the display to show Game Over and show the score.
